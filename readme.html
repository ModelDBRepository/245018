This matlab code was contributed by S Zannone.

Instructions to run the model: 
<p/>
The file seq_neuromod_plasticity.m is needed to run the plasticity
rules called +ACh and -ACh (the presence or absence of acetylcholine
can be decided with the flag ACh_flag). This is needed for Figures 2,
3 and 4. This is the bit of the code that partially overlaps with the
elife paper:<p/>
Brzosko Z, Zannone S, Schultz W, Clopath C, Paulsen O (2017) Sequential neuromodulation of Hebbian plasticity offers mechanism for effective reward-based navigation. Elife

<br/>Note: ModelDB accession number <a href="http://modeldb.yale.edu/233396">233396</a> has the same code with a different readme. 
<p/>
The same file, however, can be also used to run
simulations of the r-STDP rule by setting ACh_flag = 0 and changing
the STDP parameters (A_pre_post = pre-post window amplitude,
A_post_pre = post-pre window amplitude, tau_pre_post = pre-post window
time constant, tau_post_pre = post-pre window time constan). This is
needed to reproduce Figure 5.

<p/>The file dynamic_reward_signal.m was
used for Figure 6 and negative_feedback_signal.m is for Figure 7.
<p/>
Here is a sample screenshot from running negative_feedback_signal which displays trials 1-40 results as they run:
